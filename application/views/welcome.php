    <h1>So Glad Vintage Style Silver Jewellery</h1>
    <p>I make all the jewellery to order using silver clay. Once
        fired the pieces are 99.9% pure silver, also known as fine silver
        as they have a higher silver content than sterling silver, which
        is 92.5% silver. Each item is handmade with a vintage theme.
        Because of this, no two items ever turn out the same. Each piece
        is truly unique.</p>
